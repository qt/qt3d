ASSIMP - Open Asset Import Library
==================================

v1.1 (April 2010)

http://assimp.sourceforge.net/lib_html/index.html


ASSIMP is a library to load and process geometric scenes from various
data formats. It is tailored at typical game scenarios by supporting a
node hierarchy, static or skinned meshes, materials, bone animations and
potential texture data. The library is *not* designed for speed, it is
primarily useful for importing assets from various sources once and
storing it in a engine-specific format for easy and fast
every-day-loading. ASSIMP is also able to apply various post processing
steps to the imported data such as conversion to indexed meshes,
calculation of normals or tangents/bitangents or conversion from
right-handed to left-handed coordinate systems.

ASSIMP currently supports the following file formats (note that some
loaders lack some features of their formats because some file formats
contain data not supported by ASSIMP, some stuff would require so much
conversion work that it has not been implemented yet and some (most ...)
formats lack proper specifications):


Collada ( *.dae;*.xml )
Biovision BVH ( *.bvh )
3D Studio Max 3DS ( *.3ds )

See the Importer Notes Page for informations, what a specific importer
can do and what not. Note that although this paper claims to be the
official documentation,
http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_features_formats.html
is usually the most up-to-date list of file formats supported by the library.

3: These formats support animations, but ASSIMP doesn't yet support them
(or they're buggy)
