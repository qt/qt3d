\title Qt 3D Painting

Porting between desktop OpenGL and embedded OpenGL/ES has traditionally
been difficult.  The usual sequence of operations for a drawing request
in OpenGL consists of:

\list
    \li Select an appropriate shader program, or fixed-function pipeline
       rendering options.
    \li Set or adjust the current projection and modelview matrices.
    \li Specify vertex, normal, texture co-ordinate, and other attribute arrays.
    \li Specify textures, variables, and other rendering objects needed
       by the shader program.
    \li Draw fragments: triangles, triangle fans, quads, etc.
    \li Disable the arrays, textures, and modes that were selected.
\endlist

Desktop OpenGL, OpenGL/ES 1.1, and OpenGL/ES 2.0 all posses functionality
for the above, but they are all different.  OpenGL/ES 2.0 in particular
presents unique problems because it lacks a fixed-function pipeline mode
to perform common painting operations.

In Qt 3D, the QGLPainter class wraps OpenGL to present a consistent
OpenGL painting API across all platforms.  Shaders and fixed-function
options are supplied as an instance of QGLAbstractEffect.  Several
built-in standard effects are provided for drawing with flat colors,
material-based lighting, and simple texturing.
