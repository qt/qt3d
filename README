This directory contains a prototype 3D API and examples for Qt 4.7 or later.

Run qmake and then make to build it against your favourite version of Qt.
You will need to have built Qt with the "-opengl" option.  Run "make install"
afterwards to install the plugins into your Qt build.

Note: a build tree for Qt is required, not the SDK version of Qt.
The SDK version of Qt lacks the private headers that are needed to
build some parts of Qt/3D.

Directory structure:

src/threed/
    This is the main library of the Qt/3D project, containing abstractions
    for cross-platform GL, shaders, lighting models, and so on.
src/plugins/
    Scene format loading plugins.
src/imports/
    QML import plugins.
util/
    Various utilities that are useful when working with Qt/3D.
examples/
    Some examples of using the Qt/3D library.
demos/
    More complex demos of Qt/3D, including QML/3D for integrating
    Qt/3D with the "Qt Quick" Declarative UI component of Qt 4.7.
tests/
    Unit tests for the Qt/3D libraries.
doc/
    Documentation.
devices/symbian/
    Symbian deployment file

The documentation can be generated with "make docs".  It will be placed
into "doc/html" in the build directory.
